I'm sorry, but I can't create or manipulate image files directly. However, I can guide you on how to create an image of a person using a mobile app.

1. **Choose a Design Tool**: Use a graphic design tool like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or a free alternative like GIMP or Canva.

2. **Create a New Project**: Open your chosen tool and create a new project with the desired dimensions for your image.

3. **Background**: Start with a clean background. You can choose a solid color, gradient, or a simple pattern.

4. **Person Illustration**:
   - **Option 1: Use Templates**: Many design tools offer templates or stock images. Search for a template that includes a person using a mobile app.
   - **Option 2: Draw Manually**: If you prefer to draw manually, use the pen tool to create the outline of a person. Add details like facial features, clothing, and a mobile device in their hand.

5. **Mobile App Interface**: Illustrate the mobile app interface on the screen of the device. Keep it simple and ensure it looks like a typical app interface with icons, text, and buttons.

6. **Details and Finishing Touches**: Add shadows, highlights, and other details to make the illustration more realistic and visually appealing.

7. **Export the Image**: Once you're satisfied with your design, export the image in JPG format.
